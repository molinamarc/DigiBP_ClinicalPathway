# DigiBP_ClinicalPathway

In the healthcare sector, conceptual modeling becomes increasingly important for process optimiza- tion and standardization efforts in the context of Clinical Pathways (CP). CPs are specific, standard- ized descriptions of clinical processes for defined combinations of symptoms, which are adapted to

clinical conditions. They are geared to the whole multidisciplinary care process of a certain patient type. CPs are more than only the structure of a care process and a part of the electronic patient records. A CP is understood as a “patient-focused concept, a tool to model the care, a quality and efficiency improvement process and a product in the patient record”.
The treatment processes of CPs have to be described in their essential steps. The major impact of CPs is to foster the organization of complex medical treatment processes for similar patient types. This supports clinics in terms of economic processes and quality orientation. It also facilitates control and coordination of the treatment chain, and ensures the straightforward treatment for the patient based on treatment standards.
