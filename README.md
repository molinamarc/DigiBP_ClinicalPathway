Telemedicine pathway

Introduction 

Digitalization of consultation and appointment is the first step in transforming healthcare. Digitalization of health care is often termed as telehealth
and Telemedicine is a subset of telehealth.  Telemedicine is the practice of medicine using technology to deliver care at a distance using telecommunications infrastructure between a patient at one side and a physician or other licensed practioner at other site. 
It comprises real time synchronous care through video or phone and asynchronous visits (not happening in real time). These are often e-consults communication over email and the sharing and forwarding of patient medical data with other clinicians.

Telemedicine can involve remote patient monitoring where a provider can track a patientâ€™s health data from a remote location. This is usually done 
through medical devices used by the patient at home such as vital sign monitors. 
Difference between telemedicine and in-person visits - In many ways, a virtual meeting is same as in-person visits as both follow the same standard of 
care, same code of ethics and provide same documentation of medical record to the general practictioner. It is just different platform, but there are 
some important difference interaction is taking place between doctor and patient. Doctor can not do the physical examination by touching the patient, arranging hospital fascilities according to the location of patient. Telemedicine may be difficult to whome who are not able to use technology or can 
not acccess required tool.


Telemedicine services have these limitations - Patient may be called for in person visit or may be sent to hospital in emergency situations. Some 
patients may not able to access monitoring tools.

But, for cost saving, this is a most promising model. Many consults can be accomplished over phone or email and doctor can decide whether in person refferal is needed. many kind of pain management can be managed virtually in case of chronic pain. Prescription can be sent directly to pharmacy.



Project goal 

 To automate the  telemedicine pathway to save cost in healthcare. 
 By integrating appointment process of in-person/virtual meeting/ sending hospital, connecting doctor's presription to pharmacy, keeing lab reports, 
 making treatment plans,  we would like to create a pathway of Telemedicine
